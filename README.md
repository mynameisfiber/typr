> Quick CLI for speech to text

I got a laptop with a tiny little keyboard. This is great, but not so much when writing novels in signal.

typr is a quick cli tool for speech to text using whisper. It has two modes, "type" and "copy". In type mode, typr will type out everything you write. In copy mode, it'll copy what you say to the clipboard.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/mynameisfiber/typr.git
```

## Usage

```bash
$ typr --help
```


## Reception

"Very nice. Very useful" @mynameisfiber
